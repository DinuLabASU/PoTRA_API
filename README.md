<h1> PoTRA API </h1>

<h3> Welcome </h3>
<p>The PoTRA API is a publicly available resource for searchable protein-coding and ranked mRNA mediated dysregulated pathways from a open-access TCGA Pan-Cancer Study (manuscript in-preparation). The TCGA Pan-Cancer study is a collaboration between the Mayo Clinic, Arizona State University and Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud. </p>

<h3> The Pan-Cancer Analysis </h3>
<p>The PoTRA algorithm was applied to the open-access TCGA cancer study data (more details in the manuscript) in the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud. </p>

<h3> Ranked and Dysregulated Pathways </h3>
<p>The co-author of the manuscript in preparation, Margaret Linan created two APIs to make the results of the study publicly available.
 The results of the study can be found at the following link, and by downloading and running the PoTRA API Client (Python 3.6). </p>
 
    python PoTRA_API_Client.py primarysite=kidney
    
    Other options for 'primarysite=': breast, colorectal, kidney, liver, lung, prostate and thyroid
